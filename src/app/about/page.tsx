              <span className="text-dark-navy font-semibold">The wealth management industry has a fundamental problem.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              It&apos;s designed to manage portfolios for people who already have money while charging premium fees for generic advice that rarely moves the needle on what actually matters: taxes, estate planning, asset protection, and strategic wealth transfer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Traditional wealth managers focus obsessively on investment returns (which you can&apos;t control) while ignoring tax optimization (which you absolutely can control and which has 3-5x greater impact on wealth accumulation).
            </p>
            <p>
              They charge 1% AUM to rebalance portfolios quarterly and send you market commentary emails, while you&apos;re bleeding $200,000-$400,000 annually in unnecessary taxes that could have been legally avoided with proactive planning.
            </p>
            <p>
              CPAs file your returns reactively every April but never implement multi-year tax strategies. Estate attorneys draft documents and disappear for a decade while laws change and your wealth grows. Insurance agents sell you policies without integrating them into comprehensive estate and asset protection plans.
            </p>
            <p className="text-dark-navy font-semibold">
              Nobody coordinates. Nobody proactively brings you strategies. Nobody treats your wealth with the sophistication it deserves.
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe families who&apos;ve achieved the top 5% through relentless focus and excellence deserve wealth management that operates at the same level. You&apos;ve built something significant. Your financial strategy should reflect that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Advanced tax optimization that saves $100,000-$300,000+ annually. Sophisticated estate planning that eliminates $2 million-$8 million in unnecessary estate taxes. Asset protection structures that shield $10 million-$25 million from creditors, lawsuits, and catastrophic loss. Strategic insurance design that creates tax-free wealth transfer and liquidity.
            </p>
            <p className="text-dark-navy font-semibold">
              Not portfolio management disguised as comprehensive planning. Not reactive tax filing disguised as tax strategy. Not generic advice pulled from a drawer.

            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-warm-gray leading-relaxed mb-4">

              When a successful executive, business owner, or professional asks, &ldquo;What should I expect from my wealth advisor?&rdquo;, the answer should be: The level of sophistication, coordination, and proactive guidance that Built For Life delivers.

            <p className="text-lg text-warm-gray leading-relaxed mb-4">

            <p className="text-lg text-warm-gray leading-relaxed">
              Where paying $10,000+ annually to financial professionals actually delivers measurable ROI through tax savings, estate tax elimination, and coordinated execution. Where advisors act as true partners who bring strategies to clients proactively, respect their intelligence and time, and deliver family-office-caliber service without requiring $25M+ minimums.
